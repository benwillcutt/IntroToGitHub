Version control is a system that records changes to files or sets of files over time, allowing users to track revisions, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. It helps manage code development efficiently, facilitates teamwork, and enhances project organization by maintaining a history of modifications and enabling branching and merging of code.
